Apple Reports Record $3.38 Billion Profit for Q1 2010 on Highest Revenue in History
Monday January 25, 2010 1:02 pm PST by Eric Slivka
Apple today announced financial results for the first fiscal quarter of 2010, corresponding to the fourth calendar quarter of 2009. For the quarter, Apple posted revenue of $15.68 billion and net quarterly profit of $3.38 billion, or $3.67 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $11.88 billion and net quarterly profit of $2.26 billion, or $2.50 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin was 40.9 percent, compared to 37.9 percent in the year-ago quarter, and international sales accounted for 58 percent of the quarter's revenue. The numbers represent the most profitable quarter in Apple's history on record-breaking revenue, and include the highest Mac and iPhone quarterly sales in company history.

The company has adopted revised accounting standards that no longer require Apple to parcel out income from iPhone and Apple TV sales over a 24-month period from the date of sale, and the company has retrospectively revised financial results for previous quarters to reflect this change. Apple previously released two sets of financial numbers, one official set utilizing this subscription-based accounting for the iPhone and Apple TV and a second "non-GAAP" set that more accurately portrayed the company's performance.

Apple shipped 3.36 million Macintosh computers during the quarter, a unit increase of 33 percent over the year-ago quarter. The company also sold 21 million iPods during the quarter, representing 8 percent unit decline over the year-ago quarter. Quarterly iPhone unit sales reached 8.7 million, up 100 percent from the year-ago quarter.


"If you annualize our quarterly revenue, it's surprising that Apple is now a $50+ billion company," said Steve Jobs, Apple's CEO. "The new products we are planning to release this year are very strong, starting this week with a major new product that we're really excited about."

Apple's guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 includes expected revenue of $11.0 billion to $11.4 billion and earnings per diluted share of $2.06 to $2.18.

- Regarding iPhone inventory during the quarter, Apple could have sold "a lot more" but chose to manage inventory tightly instead.
- In answering a question about the complaints about the App Store approval process, Cook responded that it's important to keep this in perspective given that there are over 100,000 apps in the store and over 90% of these have been approved within 14 days.
